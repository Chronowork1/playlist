## Overview:
In this unit, coders will create a Playlist. The Playlist will display a list of information about different songs with images and links to play each song. To create this project, coders will create an array of objects that represent songs, use a for loop to iterate over the array of songs, and display all songs' data on the page using jQuery.

* Add a delete icon to each song that the user can click to delete the song from the playlist.
* Do not always show the inputs and the "Submit" button that add a new song. Turn the "Add Song" text into a button that toggles whether those elements are visible.
